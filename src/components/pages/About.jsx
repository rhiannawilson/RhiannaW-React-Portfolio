<p>Over the last six months, I have had the privilege of studying at the University of Sydney, expanding and developing skills in various programming technologies. In 2020, with a strong focus on frontend development, I mastered HTML5 and CSS3, completing Codecademy course which opened the doors into the world of website development.
</p> 
<p>
Fast forward to January 2024, I enrolled on the a Full Stack Engineer course with EDX Bootcamps and the University of Sydney, and became certified in August of this year. 
</p>
<p>
We delved straight into front-end basics to advanced CSS and different frameworks such as JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, before advancing to React, which became the cornerstone of my frontend expertise. I progressed into the world of backend technology, which equipped me with the ability to work with Node, Express.js, and FastAPI, gaining proficiency in several databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and became adept at utilising Sequelize and GraphQL to manage data with efficiency and precision. 
</p>
<p>
During this course we used essential tools and platforms such as Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, GitLab, and the command-line interface as well as Agile methodologies and dedicated group projects to facilitate scrum project management. I also familiarised myself with CMS platforms like WordPress and deployment services like Render, while expanding my knowledge of Apollo for state management and data fetching in React applications. 
</p>
<p>
Through this comprehensive learning experience, I have developed a versatile skill set that spans both frontend and backend technologies, enabling me to build and manage robust applications. Moreover, I am proficient in operating across different environments, including Windows and MacOS, which allows me to adapt to various development scenarios with ease. 
</p>
<p>
This journey has not only expanded my technical abilities but also reinforced my passion for software development, preparing me to tackle future challenges with confidence and creativity.
